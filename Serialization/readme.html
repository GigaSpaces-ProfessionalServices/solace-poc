<h1>GigaSpaces XAP.NET HelloWorld Example</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The HelloWorld example demonstrates writing a simple program using GigaSpaces XAP.NET. 
The program connects to a space, writes an object, and reads that object back and removes it from the space.
</p>
<p>
This example can be run with an embedded space or a remote space. 
An embedded space is a space which resides in your application's process. 
A remote space is a space which resides in another process.
</p>
<h2>Running the Example</h2>
<p> Building is not required - the example is built automatically when run. If you wish to build manually, you can execute <code>Build.bat</code>.</p>
<p>To run the example with an embedded space, execute <code>runEmbedded.bat</code>.</p>
<p>
To run the example with a remote space, first execute <code>RunRemoteSpace.bat</code>, 
wait a few seconds until you see a message saying the space was started successfully,
 then execute <code>runRemote.bat</code>.
</p>
<p>
If you prefer to use Visual Studio, you can use <code>HelloWorld.sln</code>. 
By default, running the example from Visual Studio will use an embedded space called 'EmbeddedSpace'. 
If you wish to run with a remote space, either type the remote space name in <b>Project -> Properties -> Debug -> Command line arguments</b>, or change the the code accordingly.
